        <h2>Haar Cascade</h2>
        <p>Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascades is one of the oldest,
            but most effective algorithms. It's got a Machine Learning based approach where the cascade
            function is trained with a lot of positive and negative images and then its used to detect
            the object in new environment but by heart is a brute force algorithm.
            <br>
            <br>
            After we receive the tons of examples of positive and negative images,
            then we need to extract features from it.
            For this, haar features shown in below image are used.
            They are just like our convolutional kernel.
            Each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under white rectangle
            from sum of pixels under black rectangle.

            Why I called it Brute force algorithm? Here's the explanation coming from OpenCV Library:
            <br>
            <br>
            Now all possible sizes and locations of each kernel is used to calculate plenty of features.
            (Just imagine how much computation it needs?
            Even a 24x24 window results over 160000 features).
            For each feature calculation, we need to find sum of pixels under white and black rectangles.
            To solve this, they introduced the integral images.
            It simplifies calculation of sum of pixels, how large may be the number of pixels, to an operation involving
            just four pixels.
            Nice, isnâ€™t it? It makes things super-fast.
